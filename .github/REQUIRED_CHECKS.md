# Stable branch checks

Rulesets must target `stable`, the default and release branch.

Required contexts: `required-gate`, `security-gate`, `secret-gate`.
Each aggregation job runs with `always()` and accepts only `success` from every
dependency. Failure, cancellation, or skipped dependencies must block merging.
Security scanning runs on every PR to stable, including documentation changes.
Use GitHub Actions as the required check source.

These checks cover the existing CI, dependency/CodeQL analysis and secret scans.
Release provenance validation and additional installation rehearsals are tracked
separately in xinian5216/komari-stable#3; this file does not claim they are complete.

Configure an active branch ruleset with no bypass actors: require PRs (zero
approving reviews for the solo maintainer), resolve conversations, require the
checks above with an up-to-date branch, linear history, and block deletion and
force pushes. Configure immutable release tags separately.

Changing these check names requires updating the ruleset before removing a name.
Keep release tags and existing assets immutable.
